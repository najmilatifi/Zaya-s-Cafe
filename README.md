Zaya’s Cafe 🍽

A simple C++ based restaurant ordering system

📌 Description
Zaya’s Cafe is a menu-driven console application that simulates a cafe ordering system. It allows customers to view the menu, place orders, and receive a receipt with total pricing. The system also supports staff-side functionalities such as tracking total income and profit. This project reflects strong foundational programming skills as it was built early on during my journey.
